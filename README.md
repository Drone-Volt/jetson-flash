# jetson-flash

> This tool allows users to flash BalenaOS on Jetson supported devices

This tool is separate into two parts:
- Extract BalenaOS image from a BalenaOS flasher image (this will be moved to [etcher](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher) once the fatfs issues are fixed)
- Flash BalenaOS via USB on a Jetson board (this will be moved to [etcher](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher))

---------------------

* Jetson NANO eMMC (L4T 32.6.1)
* Jetson Nano SD-CARD Devkit (L4T 32.6.1)
* Jetson Nano 2GB Devkit (L4T 32.5.1)
* Jetson TX2 (L4T 32.5.1)
* Jetson TX2 NX (in Jetson Xavier NX Devkit, L4T 32.6.1)

WARNINGS
--------

Due to issues with the fatfs node module, which does not support some operations we cannot transfer the following Balena configurations:

* system-proxy

Assumptions
-----------

- Linux based host - we test this tool with Ubuntu
- Sudo privileges

Prerequisites
-------------

- A Jetson BalenaOS image.
- Please unzip the image downloaded from the dashboard before passing it to the flashing tool.

Tool dependencies
-----------------

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (v10 or v12. Currently versions newer than v12 are incompatible, see issue #48)
- This tool runs internally the Linux_for_Tegra package, so we assume you have all the dependencies for this tool installed.

Getting Started
---------------

NOTES:
 - Make sure that the Jetson board is pluged to your host via USB and is in recovery mode
 - Running the Tegra flash tool requires sudo priviliges
 - This tool will produce all intermidiate steps in `/tmp/${pid_of_process}` and will require sudo priviliges to delete
 - If flashing Jetson TX2 with a BalenaOS image older than 2.47, please checkout tag 'v0.3.0'. BalenaOS 2.47 updated L4T version from 28.3 to 32.4.2.
 - Current BSP version used for flashing is L4T 32.6.1. Please ensure the BalenaOS version you are flashing uses the same L4T, by consulting the changelog available in the [BalenaOS Jetson repository](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-jetson/commits/master). Jetson Flash v0.5.10 should be used for flashing devices on L4T 32.4.4.
